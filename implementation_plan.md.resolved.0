# FleetSync: Unified Ride-Hailing + Logistics Platform - Implementation Plan

## Overview

FleetSync is a world-class, fully integrated web-based platform combining ride-hailing/rental services (RideSync) and logistics/warehouse management (LogiSync) into a single, real-time national operations ecosystem focused on Saudi Arabia. The platform aims to achieve 100% operational productivity by eliminating dead mileage, optimizing asset utilization, and providing seamless experiences for all stakeholders.

### Key Objectives

- **Zero Dead Mileage**: Every vehicle movement generates revenue
- **Real-Time Operations**: Live tracking and instant job allocation
- **Unified Control**: Single dashboard for all operations across Saudi Arabia
- **AI-Driven Optimization**: Predictive demand, smart allocation, profitability maximization
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every stakeholder, every scenario, every edge case

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Technology Stack Confirmation**
> The proposed stack uses React + Vite for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend, and PostgreSQL for database. Please confirm if you have preferences for:
> - Cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
> - Mapping service (Google Maps vs Mapbox - Google Maps recommended for Saudi Arabia)
> - Real-time communication (Socket.io vs WebRTC)
> - Mobile app approach (PWA vs React Native)

> [!WARNING]
> **WMS Integration Scope**
> Full integration with SAP EWM, Oracle WMS, Zoho Inventory, and Fishbowl requires enterprise API access and credentials. Initial implementation will use mock integrations with documented API contracts for future connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Existing Codebase Integration**
> You mentioned "provided map/tracking code as baseline" - please provide the existing code repository or files so we can integrate them into the new platform architecture.
